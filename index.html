<h1>one of many attempts</h1>

<p>I turned 20 yesterday. I've made a promise to myself that the day I feel like I'm at a position in my life where I'm happy, doing what I love, and feel like I've really figured something out, there's a specific song I'll listen to. This is probably a super common thing for any normal person to do, so my biggest fear as of late, and I feel that my biggest fear for the rest of my life will be never allowing myself to listen to that specific song.</p>
<p>This is an anonymous but potentially hyper personal blog, which won't be published anywhere in the forseeable future, but will just exist as on a repository - I've turned to using github, as I'm too bad at sticking to something that while paying for a domain and setting up hosting I'd probably lose all motivation for this</p>
<p>I've got some ambitions. I can't lie, I've been feeling like my worlds been falling apart for too long perhaps, I'm just terrible at convincing myself there's still time for me to potentially achieve these goals that aren't directly aligned with getting my degree, which is what I'm currently doing. It really sucks that I feel like this, and maybe when I look back at this I'll laugh about wanting to not be a software engineer, or I'll realise I was being naive about this or whatever. I just want things to be fine, and feel like I'm working things out</p>
<p>Ending this monologue, I've decided I won't state what I really plan to do with the rest of my life, or what I hope to become. Different things will probably be mentioned in what follows, and what I talk about on here, but I guess it can shift very often. I think the simplest way to put things, is that in the same way I mentioned at the start of this, I want to put something in the world that people can hold close to them - if that's some form of art then so be it. I want to create things that can make people feel warm inside, or really form core memories for people, or just let people look into the sky, roam the streets feeling some kind of way. I feel like I'm here to do something, so I just hope I do something</p>
