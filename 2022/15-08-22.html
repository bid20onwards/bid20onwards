<p>started to write some huge monologue about home</p>
<p>scrapped all of it, guess i wasnt feeling paragraphs today</p>
<p>i recorded shore sounds for a bit after work, got an online assessment invitation for 23 internship, and also got a response from a label on ig</p>
<p>neither of them guarantee anything whatsoever, but i just feel like its funny that those two kinda avenues show themself to me on the same day
  when im still struggling with all this</p>
<p>guess it just shows i can maybe make something work if i really take my time and put some effort in</p>
<p>i just gotta want it</p>
<p>imma go harder everyday at this point imma just stop complaining about shit i cant change anymore and change the shit i can change, which is way more
  than i think im pretty sure</p>
