<p>Its so hard to feel hopeful I guess</p>
<p>I spend some time scrolling twitter, trying to understand all the people behind the scene and i just realise i think im too old - how am i
supposed to get to know any of these people? maybe i fucked up when one of the artists i really liked posted up in manchester and asked for
people to dm her if they wanna be on her guestlist, but i didnt dm her and i cant remember why i thought i couldnt make it. its always small
stupid shit like this that i dont do then regret for not at least trying lol</p>
<p>its like 10am on a tuesday, imma try put more effort into work today then spend more time trying to network or get to know ANYONE in the evening,
but its just too easy to feel like im wasting my time</p>
<p>I should probably just stop obsessing over this and focus on stuff that i actually can do, need to stop playing that fast car demo on repeat in my
head</p>
